CHANGES IN spacodiR VERSION 0.13
2013-01-15
 * fixed bug in resamp.3x and resamp.2x concerning swaps with abundances of 0

CHANGES IN spacodiR VERSION 0.11
2011-01-08
 * adding formulae to spacodi.calc documentation file

2011-01-07
 * fixed bug in spacodi.by.nodes to use all reshuffling iterations

2011-07-29
  * fixed bug in check.distmat (in some cases a distance matrix was detected when untrue)

2011-04-01
  * added cophen() for rapid computation of the cophenetic matrix 
  * released to CRAN

2011-03-25
  * removed vmat() as it will be incorporated into a forthcoming update of 'geiger' and the forthcoming package 'auteur'; this revision no longer requires Rcpp as a dependency

2011-03-09
  * to improve transparency of functionality with particular classes of objects, several functions were renamed:
 	phy.dot.plot to phy.dotplot()
	Bst.permutation.plot to spacodi.permutplot()
	spacodi.tree.plot to spacodi.treeplot()
	node.time.extractor to phy.nodetimes()
	deresolve.phy to phy.deresolve()
	randomization.test.sp to resamp.test()
  * generalized plotting behavior to handle any phylogenetic- or species-diversity partitioning estimator from spacodi.calc() and spacodi.by.nodes()

2011-03-07
  * added capability for partial tree randomization with resamp.phy()
  * removed trait evolutionary functions: K.by.nodes(), Kcalc.vcv() 
  * allowed phylogeny or trait values to be represented as a cophenetic or distance matrix, respectively in spacodi.calc()

2011-03-06
  * added vmat() for fast computation of variance-covariance representation of the phylogenetic tree 
  * pooled related functions into fewer files within R/
  * removed r.sp.plot() and sim.spacodi()

2011-02-26
  * added deresolve.R to force multichotomies in a tree
